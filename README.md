Kiseki is a **free and open source** web app that allows for a deeper integration with the Aya game. Some features of Kiseki include a basic economic system, centralized user moderation, live web chat, and more.

If you would like to run Aya without the need for a website, you may use [Aya.MasterServer](https://github.com/kiseki-lol/aya-master-server).
